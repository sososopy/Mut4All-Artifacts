Issue Title:
clippy ICE: normalization works on validated constants: InterpErrorInfo · Issue #101113 · rust-lang/rust · GitHub

Rust Code:
#![feature(const_mut_refs)]

use std::cell::Cell;
use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;

#[repr(C)]
struct S {
    x: u32,
    y: E,
}

#[repr(u32)]
enum E {
    A,
    B(U)
}

union U {
    cell: ManuallyDrop<Cell<u32>>,
}

const C: S = {
    let s = S { x: 0, y: E::A };
    // Go through an &u32 reference which is definitely not allowed to mutate anything.
    let p = &s.x as *const u32 as *mut u32;
    // Change enum tag to E::B.
    unsafe { *p.add(1) = 1 };
    s
};

fn main() { //~ ERROR it is undefined behavior to use this value
    let _: &'static _ = &C; //~ ERROR erroneous constant used
    //~^ WARN this was previously accepted
}
