Issue Title:
ICE: `tuple pattern not applied to a tuple` · Issue #121410 · rust-lang/rust · GitHub

Rust Code:
fn test_missing_unsafe_warning_on_repr_packed() {
    struct Foo {
        x: String,
    }

    let foo = Foo {};

    let c = || {
        let (_, t2) = foo.x;
    };

    c();
}

Bug Trace:
//@ edition:2021

// Given how the closure desugaring is implemented (at least at the time of writing this test),
// we don't need to truncate the captured path to a reference into a packed-struct if the field
// being referenced will be moved into the closure, since it's safe to move out a field from a
// packed-struct.
//
// However to avoid surprises for the user, or issues when the closure is
// inlined we will truncate the capture to access just the struct regardless of if the field
// might get moved into the closure.
//
// It is possible for someone to try writing the code that relies on the desugaring to create a ref
// into a packed-struct. Here we test that the compiler still detects that case.
fn test_missing_unsafe_warning_on_repr_packed() {
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
    struct Foo { x: String }

    let foo = Foo { x: String::new() };

    let c = || {
        println!(unused_must_use);
        //~^ ERROR: reference to packed field is unaligned
        let (_, t2) = foo.x;
    };

    c();
}

fn main() {
    test_missing_unsafe_warning_on_repr_packed();
