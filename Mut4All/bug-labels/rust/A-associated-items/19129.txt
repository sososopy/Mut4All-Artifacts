Issue Title:
ICE: When implementing trait with a generic parameter and an associated output type · Issue #19129 · rust-lang/rust · GitHub

Rust Code:
#![feature(associated_types)]

// This was an ICE (#17388), which got fixed by #18868
trait Trait<T> {
    type Output;

    fn fun() -> <Self as Trait<T>>::Output;
}

// The new ICE gets triggered by this `impl`
impl<T> Trait<T> for () {
    type Output = ();

}

fn main() {}
