Issue Title:
ICE on nightly with associated constants · Issue #54814 · rust-lang/rust · GitHub

Rust Code:
impl<'a> GenerateFunctionBody<'a>
{
const Size: usize = 256;
const Array: [u8; Self::Size] =
[
...
];
}

This definition causes the ICE below. Replacing `Self::Size` with `256` causes the ICE to go away. Because this array is a very large constant, I've defined it in a separate file which is `include!("GenerateFunctionBody.constants.rs"); from a file which also contains a `impl<'a> GenerateFunctionBody<'a>` block. Rust is edition 2015.
