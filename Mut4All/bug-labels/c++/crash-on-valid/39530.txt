Issue Title:
clang++ errors when trying to call a constructor that automatically deduces its class template parameters from a Callable -templated class

Source Code & Bug Trace:
auto this_is_fine_in_gcc = new no_gcc_bug(instantiation); //works in gcc, does not work in clang(crash)

auto this_will_error = new bug_class(0,instantiation); //This is a bug in both GCC and clang. 
//In GCC: It errors - I don't think it should(check standard?). At the very least, the error message is wrong/confusing.
//In Clang: It crashes. 
return 0;
