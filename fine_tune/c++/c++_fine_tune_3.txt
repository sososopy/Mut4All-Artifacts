Mutation Operator: Wrap Non-Virtual Method Body in Immediately-Invoked Lambda Target Code Construct: Non-Virtual Method Definition (excluding constructors) 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify all method definitions in the main source file that: * Are **not constructors**. * Are **not virtual**. * Have a defined **function body**. 
2. Wrap the contents of the method body in a lambda expression: * Use a capture list of `[&]`. * Immediately invoke the lambda (`();`). * Insert this transformation directly inside the original function braces. 
3. Prefix the inserted code with a comment such as `/*mut3*/` to aid in debugging or tracking. 
Example: Original Code: 
int foo() { return 42; }
Mutated Code: 
int foo() { /*mut3*/[&](){ return 42; }(); }
Instructions: * Do **not** mutate constructors or virtual functions. * Ensure the insertion is inside the method body, preserving the original logic semantics. * The mutation is semantically valid but structurally redundant and may affect compiler optimization or trigger subtle backend bugs. * Randomize whether or not to apply the mutation per method to simulate variability during fuzzing.
