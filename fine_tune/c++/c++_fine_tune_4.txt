Mutation Operator: Inject Useless Enum and Using-Enum Directive into Class Target Code Construct: Class or Struct Definition, Enum Declaration, and Template Class Declaration 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify the first complete class or template class definition in the main source file. 
2. Inject a dummy scoped enum declaration (e.g., `enum class mut_4 { };`) at the beginning of this class/template. 
3. Collect all enum names declared in the translation unit. 
4. For each subsequent complete class definition:  If it does not already contain a `using enum` directive, insert a statement of the form `using enum <enum_name>;` at the end of the class body.  Randomly choose one of the collected enums for injection.  Prefix the inserted directive with a comment like `/mut4/` for traceability. 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class A { public: void foo(); }; enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }; class B { public: void bar(); };
Mutated Code: 
enum class mut_4 { }; class A { public: void foo(); }; enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }; class B { public: void bar(); /mut4/using enum mut_4; };
Instructions: Ensure `enum class mut_4` is inserted only once, at the beginning of the first matched class or template.  Use `using enum` only with valid, visible enum names.  Avoid injecting into classes that already use a `using enum` directive.  The mutation should be syntactically valid but semantically irrelevant, intended to stress test enum scoping and name resolution mechanisms in the compiler.
