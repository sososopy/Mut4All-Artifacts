Mutation Operator: Toggle Access Specifier of Constructors and Destructors Target Code Construct: Class or Struct Definition's Constructors and Destructor 
Mutation Rule: 
1. For each non-implicit constructor in a class defined in the main source file:  If the constructor's access specifier is `private` or `protected`, insert `public:` immediately before the constructor declaration, prefixed with a mutation comment `/mut10/`.  Otherwise (i.e., if `public`), insert `protected:` before the constructor declaration with the mutation comment. 
2. For the class destructor, if non-implicit and a random choice allows mutation:  Similarly toggle its access specifier between `private/protected` and `public` by inserting corresponding access labels with the mutation comment. 
3. These inserted access specifiers appear immediately before the constructor or destructor declarations in source code, altering accessibility. 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class A { protected: A() {} ~A() {} }; 
Mutated Code: 
class A { public: /mut10/A() {} /mut10/protected: ~A() {} };
Instructions:  Mutation is probabilistic per constructor and destructor (based on random index). Only apply if constructors or destructor are explicitly declared (not implicit).  Changing access specifiers may alter class usability or encapsulation, affecting client code or compiler diagnostics.  Use to evaluate compiler handling of access control changes during compilation or optimization.
