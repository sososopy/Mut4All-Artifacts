Mutation Operator: Rotate and Annotate Constructor Initializer List Order Target Code Construct: Constructor Definition with Initializer List 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify constructors in the main source file that have an initializer list with more than one member initializer. 
2. Extract all member initializer expressions from the constructor’s initializer list. 
3. Perform a rotation on the initializer list by moving the first initializer to the end, shifting others forward by one. 
4. For each initializer in the rotated list, prefix it with a mutation comment such as `/mut9/`. 
5. Replace the original initializer list entries in source code with the rotated and annotated initializers. 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class A { public: int x, y; A(int a, int b) : x(a), y(b) {} }; 
Mutated Code: 
class A { public: int x, y; A(int a, int b) : /mut9/y(b), /mut9/x(a) {} }; 
Instructions: Only apply when the constructor initializer list contains multiple initializers. The mutation may alter initialization order, potentially causing subtle semantic or runtime differences.  The inserted comment is for traceability during testing and debugging.  This mutation aims to explore compiler or runtime sensitivity to initializer ordering.
