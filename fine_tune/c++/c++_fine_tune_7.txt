Mutation Operator: Insert Explicit Default Destructor Declaration for Implicit Destructor Target Code Construct: Class or Struct Definition 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Match all complete class or struct definitions in the main source file. 
2. For each matched class, retrieve its destructor declaration (if any). 
3. If the destructor exists but is implicitly declared, insert an explicit defaulted destructor declaration. 
4. The inserted destructor declaration should:  Use the tilde `~` followed by the class name.  Be marked with `= default;`.  Be prefixed with a mutation marker comment (e.g., `/mut7/`). 
5. Insert the synthesized declaration before the closing brace of the class definition. 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class A { };
Mutated Code: 
class A { }; /mut7/~A()=default; 
Instructions:  Do not inject duplicate destructors; only mutate if the destructor is implicit.  Ensure the injected code uses the correct class name and proper syntax.  This mutation retains functional equivalence but alters the AST, which may impact compiler optimization, ABI generation, or destructor inlining behavior.  Do not apply to lambda types or incomplete definitions.
