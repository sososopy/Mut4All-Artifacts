 Mutation Operator: Switch access specifier of inherited fields using `using` declarations  Target Code Construct: Inherited protected/public fields in C++ class hierarchies  
 Mutation Rule: 
 1. Identify a derived class `D` that inherits from a base class `B`. 
 2. For every `protected` field in `B`, inject a `using B::field;` declaration under `public` section of `D`. 
 3. For every `public` field in `B`, inject a `using B::field;` declaration under `protected` section of `D`. 
 4. Insert the mutation at the end of the derived class `D`, preserving syntax validity.  
 Example: 
 Original Code 
class Base { protected: int protectedField; public: int publicField; }; class Derived : public Base {}; 
Mutated Code 
cpp class Derived : public Base { /mut8/ public: using Base :: protectedField; protected: using Base :: publicField; }; 
Instructions:  Use this operator to assess the sensitivity of field accessibility on program behavior.  Avoid applying to classes with duplicate or ambiguous member names from multiple base classes.  Best used in inheritance-heavy C++ projects.
