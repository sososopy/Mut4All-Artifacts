Mutation Operator: Insert Random Friend Class Declaration Target Code Construct: Class or Struct Definition 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Traverse all complete class or struct definitions in the main source file. 
2. Maintain a list of all such class declarations encountered so far. 
3. When visiting a new class C, randomly select a previously encountered class P from the list. 
4. Inject a friend declaration friend class P; into class C to grant friendship to class P. 
5. Prefix the inserted code with a comment for tracking.
6. Ensure each class is only visited and mutated once (based on class name). 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class A { public: void foo(); }; class B { public: void bar(); }; 
Mutated Code: 
class A { public: void foo(); }; class B { public: void bar(); /*mut2*/ friend class A; }; 
Instructions: The inserted friend class declaration must refer to an actual previously declared class in the same translation unit. Skip lambda types and incomplete class definitions. Avoid injecting duplicate friend declarations into the same class. Ensure that injected declarations are syntactically valid and appear in proper locations (e.g., before class closing brace).
