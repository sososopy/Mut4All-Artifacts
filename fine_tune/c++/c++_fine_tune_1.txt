Mutation Operator: Insert Wrapper Method for Static Non-Void Method (No Parameters) 
Target Code Construct: Class or Struct Definition with Static Non-Void Methods 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a class or struct definition that contains at least one static, non-void, and explicitly declared method. 
2. For each such method that takes zero parameters, insert a public wrapper method directly into the class body. 
3. The wrapper method should: Have return type void. 
4. Be named using a prefix (e.g., mut1_) followed by the original method name, its return type, and a timestamp or unique ID. 
5. Call the original static method inside a synthetic parameter list (e.g., (int=foo())). Contain an empty function body. 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class A { public: static int foo() { return 42; } }; 
Mutated Code: 
class A { public: static int foo() { return 42; } /*mut1*/ public: void mut1_foo_int_1721449283(int=foo()) {} }; 
Instructions: The inserted method must be syntactically valid and compilable, but semantically meaningless or misleading (e.g., synthetic parameters that mimic expressions). Wrapper methods do not serve any functional purpose and are intended to introduce potential confusion or IR generation irregularities. Do not mutate implicit methods or those with parameters. Do not insert wrapper methods into incomplete class definitions or lambda types. Ensure the mutation is applied only once per method per class to avoid excessive code bloat.
