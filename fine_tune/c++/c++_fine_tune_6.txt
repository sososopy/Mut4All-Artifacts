Mutation Operator: Flip Inheritance Access Specifiers in Base Class List Target Code Construct: Class or Struct Definition with Inheritance 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Match all complete class definitions in the main source file that declare at least one base class. 
2. For each base specifier in the class's inheritance list:  If it is explicitly marked `public`, replace it with `private`.  If it is explicitly marked `private`, replace it with `public`.  If there is no access specifier, insert `private` before the base class name. 
3. Prefix the modified base specifier with a comment like `/mut6/` to indicate mutation. 
4. Apply the transformation by replacing the entire text span corresponding to the base specifier in the source code. 
Example: 
Original Code: 
class Base {}; class Derived : public Base { }; 
Mutated Code: 
class Base {}; class Derived : /mut6/private Base { };
Instructions:  Do not mutate incomplete class definitions or classes defined outside the main file.  Only operate on syntactically valid inheritance lists.  This mutation may affect name lookup and member visibility, thus altering program semantics, which is intended for stress testing compiler behavior and access resolution.  The mutated access specifier must remain valid under C++ syntax.
