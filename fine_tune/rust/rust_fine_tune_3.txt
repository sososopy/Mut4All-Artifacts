Mutation Operator: Remove Last Match Arm Target: - Match expressions in free functions - Match expressions in methods inside `impl` blocks
Mutation Rule: 
1. Traverse all function definitions in the Rust source file, including both free functions and methods inside `impl` blocks. 
2. For each function body, inspect each statement. 
3. If the statement is a match expression, check if it contains at least one match arm. 
4. If so, remove the last arm from the match expression. 5. This transformation only affects the internal logic of match expressions, leaving the function signature and other statements untouched. 
Example Before Mutation: 
fn example(x: i32) { match x { 0 => println!(\"zero\"), 1 => println!(\"one\"), _ => println!(\"other\"), } } 
Example After Mutation: 
fn example(x: i32) { match x { 0 => println!(\"zero\"), 1 => println!(\"one\"), } } 
Explanation: This mutation operator removes the last arm of every match expression found in function bodies, whether in free-standing functions or methods within `impl` blocks. Match expressions are a core control-flow construct in Rust, and altering their completeness or coverage may trigger compiler errors or force the compiler to perform additional checks, especially when exhaustiveness or type inference is affected. This mutation increases the likelihood of triggering unexpected behavior or internal compiler errors by creating incomplete pattern coverage, especially in the presence of enums or pattern guards.
