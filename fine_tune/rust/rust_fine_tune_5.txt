Mutation Operator: Add Trait AssocType SizedBound Target: - Associated types declared inside trait definitions 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Traverse all items in the Rust source file. 
2. For each trait definition (`Item::Trait`), iterate over its inner items.
3. Identify associated type declarations (`TraitItem::Type`) within the trait. 
4. For each associated type, append the `Sized` trait bound to its bounds list using `+ Sized`. 
Example Before Mutation: 
trait MyTrait { type Output; } 
Example After Mutation: 
trait MyTrait { type Output: Sized; } 
Explanation: This mutation operator appends a `Sized` bound to associated types declared inside trait definitions. By introducing the `Sized` constraint, the mutation potentially restricts the implementability of traits for unsized types such as `str` or dynamically-sized slices. This transformation is designed to test the compiler's handling of trait resolution and bound propagation, especially in scenarios involving default generic bounds, object safety, or advanced trait features like GATs (Generic Associated Types). It also increases the semantic complexity of trait definitions, which may trigger edge-case behavior in trait checking or code generation phases.
