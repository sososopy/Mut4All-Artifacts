Mutation Operator: Modify ImplTrait Return Type Target: - Free functions that return `impl Trait` 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Traverse all free function definitions in the source file. 
2. Identify functions whose return type is an `impl Trait` (anonymous `impl` type). 
3. For each such function, replace the entire function body with a single expression statement `()`. 
4. This effectively clears the original logic and replaces it with a unit expression. 
Example Before Mutation: 
fn foo() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> { (0..10).filter(|x| x % 2 == 0) }
Example After Mutation: 
fn foo() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> { () } 
Explanation: This mutation operator targets functions returning `impl Trait` by clearing their bodies and replacing them with a trivial unit expression. The operator tests the compiler's ability to handle functions with opaque return types but no meaningful implementation. This can expose issues related to type checking, monomorphization, and code generation for `impl Trait` functions when their bodies are unexpectedly empty or nonsensical.
