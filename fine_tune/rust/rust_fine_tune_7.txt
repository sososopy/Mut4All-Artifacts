Mutation Operator: Add Associated Type To Trait Target: - Trait definitions
Mutation Rule: 
1. Traverse all trait definitions in the Rust source file. 
2. For each trait, append a new associated type named `AssocType` without any bounds, defaults, or attributes. 
3. This effectively extends the trait with a new associated type placeholder. 
Example Before Mutation: 
trait MyTrait { fn do_something(&self); } 
Example After Mutation: 
trait MyTrait { fn do_something(&self); type AssocType; } 
Explanation: This mutation operator adds a new associated type `AssocType` to every trait definition. By extending traits with additional associated types, it increases the complexity of trait resolution and implementations. This transformation can expose compiler bugs in trait checking, type inference, and monomorphization when dealing with traits that unexpectedly gain new associated types. It is useful for testing the compiler's robustness in handling evolving trait definitions and associated type inference.
