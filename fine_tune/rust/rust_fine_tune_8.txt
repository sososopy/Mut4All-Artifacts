Mutation Operator: Add Static Lifetime To Reference Params Target: - Reference types in function parameters of free functions and methods inside impl blocks 
Mutation Rule: 
1. Traverse all function definitions in the source file, including free functions and methods in impl blocks. 
2. For each function parameter that is a reference type (`&T` or `&mut T`): - Add the explicit `'static` lifetime to the reference, transforming it into `&'static T` or `&'static mut T`. 
3. Leave non-reference parameters unchanged. 
4. This mutation makes lifetimes more explicit and forces the compiler to handle `'static` lifetime annotations on references. 
Example Before Mutation: 
fn foo(x: &i32, y: &mut String) {} impl MyStruct { fn bar(&self, s: &str) {} } 
Example After Mutation: 
fn foo(x: &'static i32, y: &'static mut String) {} impl MyStruct { fn bar(&self, s: &'static str) {} } 
Explanation: This mutation operator explicitly adds the `'static` lifetime to all reference types found in function and method parameters. By making lifetimes explicit and forcing them to `'static`, the operator increases the strictness of lifetime checking and can expose bugs or inconsistencies in lifetime inference and checking phases of the compiler. It also tests the compiler's ability to handle explicit `'static` lifetimes in various contexts, especially when the original code used elided or shorter lifetimes.
