## Notes on Rust

- **rustc** 
  In rustc, there are some open issue bugs that have been fixed in the latest version of the rustc compiler. However, these issues have not been closed by developers (e.g., [rustc-138225](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/138225)). After testing on the latest rustc nightly, we confirm that this bug has been fixed.
